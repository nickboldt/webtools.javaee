 * 6.8 Stateless session beans
 *...
 * The home interface of a stateless session bean must have one create 
 * method that takes no arguments and returns the session bean's remote 
 * interface. There can be no other create methods in the home interface. 
 * The session bean class must define a single ejbCreate method that takes 
 * no arguments.
 *...
 *
 * 6.10.6 Session bean's home interface
 * The following are the requirements for the session bean's home interface:
 *   - The interface must extend the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface.
 *   - The methods defined in this interface must follow the rules for RMI/IIOP. 
 *     This means that their argument and return values must be of valid types 
 *     for RMI/IIOP, and that their throws clause must include the java.rmi.RemoteException.
 *   - The home interface is allowed to have superinterfaces. Use of interface 
 *     inheritance is subject to the RMI/IIOP rules for the definition of 
 *     remote interfaces.
 *   - A session bean's home interface must define one or more create(...) methods.
 *   - Each create method must be named "create", and it must match one of 
 *     the ejbCreate methods defined in the session bean class. The matching 
 *     ejbCreate method must have the same number and types of arguments. 
 *     (Note that the return type is different.)
 *   - The return type for a create method must be the session bean's remote 
 *     interface type.
 *   - All the exceptions defined in the throws clause of an ejbCreate method 
 *     of the session bean class must be defined in the throws clause of the 
 *     matching create method of the home interface.
 *   - The throws clause must include javax.ejb.CreateException.
 *...
 *
 * 9.2.8 Entity bean's home interface
 * The following are the requirements for the entity bean's home interface:
 *   - The interface must extend the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface.
 *   - The methods defined in this interface must follow the rules for RMI-IIOP. 
 *     This means that their argument and return types must be of valid types for 
 *     RMI-IIOP, and that their throws clause must include the java.rmi.RemoteException.
 *   - The home interface is allowed to have superinterfaces. Use of interface 
 *     inheritance is subject to the RMI-IIOP rules for the definition of remote interfaces.
 *   - Each method defined in the home interface must be one of the following:
 *      - A create method.
 *      - A finder method.
 *   - Each create method must be named "create", and it must match one of the 
 *     ejbCreate methods defined in the enterprise Bean class. The matching 
 *     ejbCreate method must have the same number and types of its arguments. 
 *     (Note that the return type is different.)
 *   - The return type for a create method must be the entity bean's remote interface type.
 *   - All the exceptions defined in the throws clause of the matching ejbCreate 
 *     and ejbPostCreate methods of the enterprise Bean class must be included in 
 *     the throws clause of the matching create method of the home interface 
 *     (i.e the set of exceptions defined for the create method must be a superset
 *     of the union of exceptions defined for the ejbCreate and ejbPostCreate methods)
 *   - The throws clause of a create method must include the javax.ejb.CreateException.
 *   - Each finder method must be named "find<METHOD>" (e.g. findLargeAccounts), and it
 *     must match one of the ejbFind<METHOD> methods defined in the entity bean class 
 *     (e.g. ejbFindLargeAccounts). The matching ejbFind<METHOD> method must have the 
 *     same number and types of arguments. (Note that the return type may be different.)
 *   - The return type for a find<METHOD> method must be the entity bean's remote 
 *     interface type (for a single-object finder), or a collection thereof (for a 
 *     multi-object finder).
 *   - The home interface must always include the findByPrimaryKey method, which is 
 *     always a single-object finder. The method must declare the primary key class 
 *     as the method argument.
 *   - All the exceptions defined in the throws clause of an ejbFind method of the 
 *     entity bean class must be included in the throws clause of the matching find 
 *     method of the home interface.
 *   - The throws clause of a finder method must include the javax.ejb.FinderException.
