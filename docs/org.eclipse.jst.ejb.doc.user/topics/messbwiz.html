<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating Message-driven Beans</h1>



<div><p>You can use a wizard to create a message-driven bean and add it
to your project.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The message-driven bean wizard helps you create an Enterprise
message-driven bean by walking you through the creation process and by providing
you with output files that you can use or that you can modify for use with
your application.</p>
 <p>To create a message-driven bean, complete the following
steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>From the Javaâ„¢ EE perspective, expand your  EJB project
in the Project Explorer view.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Right click on the <strong>Message-Driven Bean</strong> icon, and select <span class="menucascade">
<span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Message-Driven Bean</span></span> from
the pop-up menu.</span>  The <span class="uicontrol">Create Message-Driven Bean</span> wizard
appears.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Follow the project wizard prompts.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Destination name</strong></dt>

<dd>This field provides the attribute <strong>mappedName</strong> to the <strong>@MessageDriven</strong> annotation.
This attribute specifies the product-specific name to which the message-driven
bean should be mapped. You can also use this attribute to specify the JNDI
name of the destination from which the bean will consume messages.</dd>

</dl>
 <dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Destination type</strong></dt>

<dd>To send a JMS message, we need a connection to the JMS provider and a
destination address for the message. A JMS connection factory makes the connection
to the provider possible. In JMS, messages are not sent directly to applications;
they are sent to topics or queues:<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Queue:</dt>

<dd>Queue is used as a destination for pointtopoint messaging. The <strong>point-to-point</strong> 
messaging model allows JMS clients to send and receive messages both synchronously
and asynchronously via virtual channels known as <em>queues</em>. The p2p messaging
model has traditionally been a pull- or polling-based model, where messages
are requested from the queue instead of being pushed to the client automatically.
A queue may have multiple receivers, but only one receiver may receive each
message.  Messages holding this queue are of <strong>MapMessages</strong> type, which
stores the information about the email as name/value pair.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Topic:</dt>

<dd>Topic is used as a destination for publish/subscribe messaging. In <strong>publish-and-subscribe</strong> 
messaging, one producer can send a message to many consumers through a virtual
channel called a <em>topic</em>. Consumers can choose to subscribe to a topic.
Any messages addressed to a topic are delivered to all the topic's consumers.
Every consumer receives a copy of each message. The pub/sub messaging model
is a push-based model, where messages are automatically broadcast to consumers
without them having to request or poll the topic for new messages. In the
pub/sub messaging model, the producer sending the message is not dependent
on the consumers receiving the message. Optionally, JMS clients that use pub/sub
can establish durable subscriptions that allow consumers to disconnect and
later reconnect and collect messages that were published while they were disconnected.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

</dl>
 <dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Transaction type</strong></dt>

<dd>The <strong>Transaction type</strong> field is used to specify whether the transaction
is handled by the <strong>Container</strong> or the <strong>Bean</strong>.</dd>

</dl>
 <dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><strong>Interfaces</strong></dt>

<dd>Message-driven beans usually implement the <strong>javax.jms.MessageListener</strong> 
interface. A <em>MessageListener object</em> is used to receive asynchronously
delivered messages. This interface defines the <strong>onMessage()</strong> method.
This method processes the JMS messages received by a bean.</dd>
