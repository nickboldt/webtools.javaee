/**
 * This is to test for defect [46376].
 * 
 * SameName test. This is test where you have this:
 * 	initParserTest46376.SameNameTestClass.java
 * 	InitParserTest46376.java
 *  
 * Before [46376] the Static parser would find throw NoClassDefFoundError on initParserTest46376 when looking for
 * SameNameTestClass and never find the class.
 * 
 * To compile in Eclipse we need to have one of the classes be in the default package. Eclipse complains if we didn't.
 * But there is nothing to stop this from happening with packages too if they are spread across compile groups.
